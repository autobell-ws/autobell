```

*   **Web Dashboard (React + Vite):** Hosted at [https://autobell-q2um5zzqi-autobell-ws.vercel.app/](https://autobell-q2um5zzqi-autobell-ws.vercel.app/). School admins manage schedules, audio files, and user access. Super Admins manage global inventory, schools, and partner accounts.
*   **Mobile Application (React Native / Expo):** Used by school staff for manual bell triggers, broadcasts, and Emergency Mode.
*   **Supabase Cloud Backend:** Handles database records (PostgreSQL), file storage (buckets: `audio-files`, `voice-notes`, `school-branding`, `firmware`), realtime push updates via WebSockets, and serverless Edge Functions.
*   **Smart Bell Devices (ESP32 Firmware):** Physical controllers connected to speakers/amplifiers. Connects via WiFi, syncs time via NTP, polls backend for schedules (stored in local LittleFS/SPIFFS cache for offline resilience), and listens to WebSockets (Supabase Realtime) for manual/emergency triggers.

## 2. User Roles & Account Configurations

AutoBell is a multi-tenant system. Strict Row-Level Security (RLS) ensures schools only see their own data.

1.  **Super Admin (Platform Owner):**
    *   **Access:** Managed through the `super_admin` role. Promoted using `SELECT setup_super_admin('email')`.
    *   **Core Functions:** Full CRUD on all tables, global inventory management, claiming/unassigning/retiring devices, uploading OTA firmware.
    *   **Primary Account:** `muddasirh@gmail.com`
2.  **School Admin (Tenant Owner):**
    *   **Access:** Managed through the `admin` role. Assigned to exactly one `school_id`.
    *   **Core Functions:** Manage school profiles, bell schedules, user management (inviting operators), and backup/restore.
    *   **Example Account:** `digitapbs@gmail.com`
3.  **Operator (School Staff):**
    *   **Access:** Managed through the `operator` role. Scoped to a `school_id`.
    *   **Core Functions:** Read-only schedule views, manual triggers, emergency overrides.
4.  **Partner Portal Users:**
    *   **Access:** Third-party partners/resellers who onboard schools and manage initial device registrations.

## 3. Device Lifecycle Management

Devices follow a strict progression to ensure physical inventory is kept in sync:

1.  **Factory Phase:** Devices are manufactured and added to `device_inventory` (mac_address, serial_number).
2.  **Claiming/Registration:** When a school buys a device, the School Admin enters the serial number via the Dashboard. The `claim_device` RPC is called, linking the device to the school's `school_id` and creating a row in `bell_devices`.
3.  **Unassigning Devices (Super Admin Only):** If a device is moved to a new school, the Super Admin calls `unassign_device(p_device_id)`. This resets `claimed_at` and `claimed_by_school_id` in `device_inventory`, and deletes the `bell_devices` row (cleaning up logs and command history via cascading deletes). The device can then be claimed again by another school.
4.  **Retiring Devices (Super Admin Only):** If a device is damaged or destroyed, the Super Admin calls `retire_device(p_device_id, p_reason)`. This marks it as retired (`retired_at` timestamp set) in `device_inventory`, ensuring it can never be claimed again, and deletes the `bell_devices` row.
5.  **Backup Device Service:** Clients with a yearly agreement get spare devices in case of failure. The replacement device can be claimed via serial number to automatically inherit the existing school schedule and audio files.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Client Issues

### A. Device is Offline / Dashboard status is "Offline"
1.  **Green LED Status:**
    *   **Off:** No power or WiFi issue. Ensure power supply is connected (5V/2A).
    *   **Blinking:** Attempting to connect to WiFi. If it keeps blinking, WiFi credentials might have changed or router is out of range.
    *   **Solid On:** WiFi connected. If the dashboard still says offline, it's a websocket/API handshake issue.
2.  **Action Plan:**
    *   Ask the client to power-cycle the device (unplug for 10 seconds, plug back in).
    *   Verify if NTP sync works (rebooting forces NTP sync).
    *   If WiFi changed, use the **WiFi Setup Portal**:
        1. Search for a WiFi network named `AutoBell-Setup` on a phone/laptop.
        2. Connect to it and navigate to `192.168.4.1` in a browser.
        3. Enter the new SSID and Password, then click save.

### B. Bell Does Not Ring at Scheduled Time
1.  **Verify Schedule & Profile:**
    *   Check if the correct profile is marked as **Active** (e.g., "Regular Day" vs "Exam Day").
    *   Ensure the schedule entry is set for the correct day of the week.
    *   *Note:* Changes to schedules can take up to 5 minutes to sync to the device.
2.  **Perform Manual Test:**
    *   Ask the user to tap "Manual Trigger" in the mobile app or dashboard.
    *   *If manual trigger works:* The speaker connection, power, and audio file are fine. The issue is schedule syncing or incorrect system time. Reboot the device to force NTP time synchronization.
    *   *If manual trigger fails:* Check if the speaker wire is loose, device volume is set to 0, or the audio file is missing/corrupted.

### C. Audio Sounds Crackly, Cuts Out, or "Skips"
1.  **Power Supply Issue:** ESP32 and speakers draw high current. A standard phone charger (< 2A) will cause voltage drops, leading to crackling audio or unexpected reboots.
    *   *Fix:* Ensure the client is using a high-quality 5V/2A power adapter.
2.  **Audio File Issue:**
    *   Keep MP3 files short (under 30 seconds) for optimal performance.
    *   Test playing the file via the Audio Manager preview to check for corruption.
3.  **Hardware Variant:** Check if the device is using a DFPlayer Mini vs I2S amplifier. If it's a DFPlayer, ensure the SD card is seated properly.

### D. Device Randomly Restarts
1.  **Watchdog Timer (WDT):** The device firmware includes a 60-second hardware watchdog. If the system hangs or freezes (e.g., during network drops or memory exhaustion), the WDT triggers a reset to ensure 100% uptime.
2.  **Action Plan:**
    *   If it happens rarely, reassure the client this is normal auto-recovery.
    *   If it happens constantly, check the power supply stability or review the device's diagnostic logs on the dashboard for repeating errors.

### E. "Failed to Fetch" or Login Failures
1.  **Client Browser Console:** Check if there are CORS errors or network blocks (common on school networks with strict firewalls).
2.  **Account Verification:**
    *   Ensure the user's email has been confirmed in `auth.users`.
    *   Verify if the user's school has been suspended (`suspended = true`).
    *   Check if their role is correctly set (`admin` or `operator`) in `public.users`.

## 5. Support Diagnostics and CLI Scripts

As a support engineer, you can run diagnostic scripts from the `web-dashboard` directory to query and troubleshoot issues without manual SQL operations:

*   **Check basic database connectivity & user status:**
    ```bash
    node scripts/diagnostic_check.js
    ```
*   **Check active schedules & registered devices for a school:**
    ```bash
    node scripts/check_db_schedules.js
    ```
*   **Verify users, roles, and correct admin roles:**
    ```bash
    node scripts/check_users_and_devices.js
    ```
*   **Test TTS engine by sending a message to a device:**
    ```bash
    node scripts/send_tts.js
    ```
*   **Recreate/repair Super Admin profile configuration:**
    ```bash
    node scripts/recreate-super-admin-profile.js
    ```

## 6. DB Query Reference for Support Engineers

Run these queries directly in the Supabase SQL Editor to resolve account and hardware issues:

### A. Promote user to Super Admin
```sql
SELECT setup_super_admin('support.engineer@autobell.com');
```

### B. Register/Claim a device manually for a school
```sql
-- Replace with the correct serial number and desired device name, executed as the school admin
SELECT claim_device('AB-123456', 'Main Campus Bell');
```

### C. Find a device by MAC Address or Serial
```sql
SELECT * FROM device_inventory WHERE mac_address = '24:6F:28:A1:B2:C3';
SELECT * FROM bell_devices WHERE mac_address = '24:6F:28:A1:B2:C3';
```

### D. Clear device claim status (Manual fallback for unassigning)
```sql
UPDATE device_inventory
SET claimed_at = NULL, claimed_by_school_id = NULL
WHERE serial_number = 'AB-123456';

DELETE FROM bell_devices WHERE mac_address = '24:6F:28:A1:B2:C3';
```

### E. View device heartbeats and diagnostic logs
```sql
SELECT mac_address, last_heartbeat, status, input_power, firmware_version
FROM bell_devices
ORDER BY last_heartbeat DESC LIMIT 50;

SELECT * FROM device_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100;
```

### F. Check if a school is suspended
```sql
SELECT id, name, suspended FROM schools WHERE name ILIKE '%School Name%';
```

## 7. Backup & Restore Operations

1.  **Process Details:**
    *   School admins can back up all schedules, logs, and MP3 files from settings. The file downloaded has a `.abk` extension (actually a standard ZIP package containing `metadata.json`, `database.json`, and the binary files from storage folders).
    *   When restoring, the dashboard extracts this zip, uploads the files to storage, and calls the PostgreSQL transaction `restore_school_backup(p_payload jsonb)`.
2.  **Common Failures:**
    *   **Corrupted Backup File:** Ensure the file extension is `.abk` or `.zip` and can be opened with standard extraction tools.
    *   **Schema Mismatches:** If new columns were added to the database since the backup was made, the restore RPC might fail. Verify schema versions in `metadata.json`.
