## 🌟 Key Features & Core Capabilities

*   **Cloud-Based Remote Scheduling:** Create, manage, and switch profile schedules (Normal Day, Exam Mode, Ramadan, Weekend) from anywhere.
*   **System-Wide Pre-Announcement Audio Jingle & Delay:** School Admins can select a signature pre-announcement chime from a global library and set a custom pause delay (2–5 seconds) before any bell, TTS notice, voice note, or announcement plays.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS) & Live Broadcasts:** Schedule automated TTS spoken announcements or broadcast live/recorded voice messages instantly from web or mobile.
*   **Offline-First Reliability:** ESP32 controllers cache all profiles and schedule JSON locally in LittleFS/SPIFFS. Bells ring on time even during Wi-Fi or internet outages.
*   **Hardware Watchdog (100% Uptime):** Built-in automatic hardware freeze recovery ensures zero manual restarts or downtime.
*   **Instant Emergency Triggers:** Dedicated lockdown and emergency alarm modes accessible via authorized mobile apps and web dashboards.
*   **Full Data Backup & Restore:** Complete data safety with 1-click backup and restore for database records, active schedules, diagnostic logs, and uploaded MP3 audio media.
*   **Partner & Reseller Portal:** Dedicated portal for school IT vendors and distributors to manage leads, deals, payments, commissions, and customer onboarding.
*   **Multi-Tenant SaaS Security:** Powered by Supabase PostgreSQL with strict Row Level Security (RLS) and Role-Based Access Control (Super Admin, School Admin, Operator, Partner).
*   **Zero-Downtime Backup Device Guarantee:** Optional yearly SaaS agreement providing immediate hardware replacement from central inventory.
